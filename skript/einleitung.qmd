# Welcome to Python!

Python is a modern programming language that is especially well-suited for beginners. 
It is easy to understand and used in many fields – from data analysis to web development.

> In this course, you will learn Python step by step through practical examples.

## Learning goals of this chapter

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- write simple Python programs,
- display text on the screen,
- define and use basic variables.

## Your first program

The first steps in any new programming language are always the same. 
We start by printing the words 'Hello World'. For this, we use the `print()` command:

```{python}
print("Hello World!")
```

**What happens here?**
- `print()` is a **function** that displays something on the screen.
- The text `"Hello World!"` is shown.
- Texts (also called “strings”) are always enclosed in quotation marks.

## Variables – Names for values

Variables are like labeled drawers: they store information under a name.

```{python}
name = "Ms. Miller"
age = 32
```

You can use these variables to create dynamic output:

```{python}
print(name + " is " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

Note that here you are trying to output both a number and text. Therefore, we use the `str()` function to convert the number into text.

## ✏️ Exercise: Greeting with age

Write a program that greets you with your name:

```
Hello Ms. Miller!
```

Tip: In Python, you can concatenate text using `+`. Remember that 
strings must be in quotation marks.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{python}
my_name = "Your name here"
print("Hello " + my_name + "!")
```
:::

Extend your program so that it greets you and also states your age:

```
Hello Ms. Miller!
You are 32 years old.
```

Tip: Use multiple `print()` statements or concatenate the text.

::: {.callout-caution icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{python}
name = "Ms. Miller"
age = 32

print("Hello " + name + "!")
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
```
